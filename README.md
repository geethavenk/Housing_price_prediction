# Housing Price Prediction


This project delves into the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-data-for-ml-course/data) housing dataset, comprising 79 variables detailing diverse aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The dataset has been partitioned into training and test sets. The objective is to forecast the final Sale Price of houses in the test dataset.

Advanced feature engineering is leveraged to deduce missing values in the dataset. Categorical features are converted into numerical features using one-hot encoding. The performances of several regression techniques, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, are evaluated, and the optimal model is identified.

### Technologies used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- seaborn and matplotlib for data visualization
- sklearn for model training
